I'm a data scientist with a passion for building products that help people. I'm currently working
on applications of AI/ML methods with physical constraints and inverse problems. I started my career in
geophysics and worked on nuclear explosion monitoring and deep learning/generative model applications
for seismic imaging and inversion.
