I'm an applied data scientist/engineer with a passion for building products that help people. I'm currently working
on AI Agents. Previously I've worked on applications of AI/ML methods with physical constraints and inverse problems. 
My early background is in applied physics, where I primarily focused on seismic wave propagation. Let's connect!
**I'm still working on building this page, and content will be updated frequently**
